# Introduction
 
The annual FTC data book from 2021 reports nearly 390,000 counts for credit card fraud making it the second most common type of identity theft. Although credit card information can be fraudulently used in many ways, we only focus on the retail transactions for the purpose of this project. Card-not-present transactions occur when a fraudster uses the credit card details but not the actual credit card to perform online, over-the-phone, or mail order transactions. These transactions alone accounted for an estimated US $5.72 billion losses in the US in 2022.

Currently much of the fraudulent transactions are self-reported by the victims or flagged by the banks due to suspicious behaviour. However, as technology gets advanced, fraudsters find new ways to steal and misuse someoneâ€™s credit card information. In many a case, the damage done is irreversible by the time a fraud is reported. The purpose of our project is to utilize transactions data and investigate what factors can be used to classify a credit card transaction as fraudulent.

Using credit card transactions dataset from Kaggle, we aim to determine the key features of a fraudulent credit card transaction by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). Based on findings from the EDA, we aim to build machine learning models which can identify fraudulent transactions based on the key features.
